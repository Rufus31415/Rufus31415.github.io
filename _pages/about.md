Hi, my name is Florent GIRAUD aka Rufus31415. I don't know why I chose this nickname, it's quite recent, maybe because I like the first name Rufus and PI...


Anyway, for a long time I've been participating in online forums of programming, makers, geek, ... I've often needed to expose examples online, so I decided to create this little website hoping that it will help other enthusiasts.

This blog will only deal with my life as a passionate geek, the one I have in the evening or early morning outside of my family and professional life.

In life, I also have a geek job, I'm an industrial computer engineer and I design special machines for the high-tech industry like energy, off-road, aeronautics, aerospace, automotive, industry 4.0, etc.

I'm passionate about new technologies, how they help us. I am also in love with mathematics and its beauty.

I spent a lot of time when I was younger on robotics projects, internet of objects, Arduino based projects, microcontroller, FPGA, machining, 3D printing, embedded code, video game, lego Mindstorms, 3D CAD,... I have less time now, but I try to always have a side project to stay young in my head ;)

Okay, I don't want to reveal anything confidential about my life here, but here are some very personal things I can share:

Blood group: C++

Height: 100vh

Age : <span id="age">25</span> years old

function update(){
document.getElementById("age").innerText = Date.now()/31557600000 - 118062907/ 5259600
	setTimeout(update, 100);
}
update();
